# Developing-Data-Products--Project
Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

# This peer assessed assignment has two parts. 
First, I will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

# mtcar dataset:
Suppose, I work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

# “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG” "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
